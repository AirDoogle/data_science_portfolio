## Handwritten Digit Recognition with MNIST

[Github](https://github.com/AirDoogle/data_science_portfolio/blob/main/ml_handwritten_digit_recognition.ipynb) [nbviewer](https://nbviewer.org/github/AirDoogle/data_science_portfolio/blob/main/ml_handwritten_digit_recognition.ipynb)

This project demonstrates the implementation of a machine learning model to classify handwritten digits using the [MNIST dataset](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MNIST_database). The notebook utilizes TensorFlow and Keras for training a neural network on the dataset. Key tasks include:

- Loading and preprocessing the MNIST dataset.
- Building and training a neural network model.
- Evaluating the model's performance on unseen data.

This project highlights foundational deep learning techniques, such as data normalization, model training, and evaluation metrics, to solve a classic problem in computer vision.

## Classification problems.

### Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster



Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster is a knowledge competition on Kaggle. Many people started practicing in machine learning with this competition, so did I. This is a binary classification problem: based on information about Titanic passengers we predict whether they survived or not. General description and data are available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic).
Titanic dataset provides interesting opportunities for feature engineering.


## Regression problems.

### House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques

House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques is a knowledge competition on Kaggle. This is a regression problem: based on information about houses we predict their prices. General description and data are available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques).
The dataset has a lot of features and many missing values. This gives interesting possibilities for feature transformation and data visualization.

### Loan Prediction



## Natural language processing.

### Bag of Words Meets Bags of Popcorn


Bag of Words Meets Bags of Popcorn is a sentimental analysis problem. Based on texts of reviews we predict whether they are positive or negative. General description and data
The data provided consists of raw reviews and class (1 or 2), so the main part is cleaning the texts.

### NLP with Python: exploring Fate/Zero

Natural language processing in machine learning helps to accomplish a variety of tasks, one of which is extracting information from texts. This notebook is an overview of several text exploration methods using English translation of Japanese light novel "Fate/Zero" as an example.

### NLP. Text generation with Markov chains


This notebook shows how a new text can be generated based on a given corpus using an idea of Markov chains. I start with simple first-order chains and with each step improve model to generate better text.

### NLP. Text summarization


This notebook shows how text can be summarized choosing several most important sentences from the text. I explore various methods of doing this based on a news article.

## Clustering

### Clustering with KMeans


Clustering is an approach to unsupervised machine learning. Clustering with KMeans is one of algorithms of clustering. in this notebook I'll demonstrate how it works. Data used is about various types of seeds and their parameters. It is availae
## Neural networks

### Feedforward neural network with regularization


This is a simple example of feedforward neural network with regularization. It is based on Andrew Ng's lectures on Coursera. I used data from Kaggle's challenge "Ghouls, Goblins, and Ghosts... Boo!".

## Data exploration and analysis

### Telematic data

I have a dataset with telematic information about 10 cars driving during one day. I visualise data, search for insights and analyse the behavior of each driver. I can't share the data, but here is the notebook. I want to notice that folium map can't be rendered by native github, but nbviewer.jupyter can do it.

## Recommendation systems.

### Collaborative filtering


Recommenders are systems, which predict ratings of users for items. There are several approaches to build such systems and one of them is Collaborative Filtering. 
This notebook shows several examples of collaborative filtering algorithms.
